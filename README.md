# Writing Portfolio

This repository contains a small, curated portfolio of writing and editorial work.

The emphasis throughout is on clarity, structure, and responsibility for meaning,
particularly in complex or sensitive subject areas. The examples are intended to
demonstrate judgement rather than speed, automation, or stylistic novelty.

The portfolio is presented as a simple static website for ease of review.

## Portfolio Structure

The site consists of three selected samples, each illustrating a different type
of writing or editorial skill:

1. **Technical Rewrite**  
   A before-and-after example showing the professional restructuring and editing
   of a dense technical document. The focus is on improving clarity and coherence
   while preserving scientific accuracy.

2. **Structured Dialogue / Self-Interview**  
   A conceptual dialogue exploring cognition, self-assessment, and reasoning,
   presented in a disciplined, readable form.

3. **Health Writing Example**  
   A clear, responsible explanation of a simple health-related practice, written
   for an intelligent general audience without sensationalism or oversimplification.

Each sample includes brief contextual notes explaining what was done and why.

## Design Philosophy

The site design is intentionally minimal:

- plain HTML and CSS
- no frameworks or scripts
- emphasis on readability and hierarchy
- restrained typography and generous white space

The aim is to keep attention on the writing itself.

---

## Authorship

All writing and editorial judgement shown here is human-authored.
Tools may be used in the drafting process, but responsibility for structure,
tone, and final wording rests with the author.
